# Agile Development
I utilized GitHub Issues and Projects for writing and managing user stories and epics. The Kanban board was employed to categorize stories into Todo, In Progress, and Done columns. Additionally, I applied the MoSCoW method to label stories as Must-Have, Could-Have and Should-Have.
